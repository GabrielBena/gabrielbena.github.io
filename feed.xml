Recent advancements have extended cellular automata into continuous domains, raising the question of whether these systems retain the capacity for universal computation. In parallel, neural cellular automata have emerged as a powerful paradigm where rules are learned via gradient descent rather than manually designed. This work explores the potential of neural cellular automata to develop a continuous Universal Cellular Automaton through training by gradient descent. We introduce a cellular automaton model, objective functions and training strategies to guide neural cellular automata toward universal computation in a continuous setting. Our experiments demonstrate the successful training of fundamental computational primitives — such as matrix multiplication and transposition — culminating in the emulation of a neural network solving the MNIST digit classification task directly within the cellular automata state. These results represent a foundational step toward realizing analog general-purpose computers, with implications for understanding universal computation in continuous dynamics and advancing the automated discovery of complex cellular automata behaviors via machine learning.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="background-color: white; border-radius: 8px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/unca/grant_task_evolution-480.webp 480w,/assets/unca/grant_task_evolution-800.webp 800w,/assets/unca/grant_task_evolution-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/unca/grant_task_evolution.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Our framework performs matrix operations (translation, multiplication, rotation) through continuous cellular interactions evolving over time (from t=0 to t=60). The inset reveals the core mechanism: cells communicating only with neighbors, and interacting with a local fixed (but learned) heterogeneous substrate, are able to collectively solve mathematical tasks without explicit algorithms. </div> <h2 id="introduction-and-background">Introduction and Background</h2> <p>Cellular Automata (CA) represent a fascinating class of computational models that have captivated researchers across disciplines for their ability to produce complex behaviors from simple rules <d-cite key="computational_beauty"></d-cite>. At their core, CA typically consist of a grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, which evolve over discrete time steps based on a fixed deterministic rule. This rule, applied uniformly to all cells, governs the state transition of each cell based solely on its current state and those of its neighbors. Despite their simplicity, CA have become a cornerstone in studying emergence and complexity <d-cite key="wolfram_cellular_1984"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Several discrete CA models, including Conway’s Game of Life <d-cite key="cgol,life_turing_2016"></d-cite>, Rule 110 of Elementary Cellular Automata <d-cite key="wolfram,cook"></d-cite>, Langton’s Ant <d-cite key="langton"></d-cite>, and Wireworld <d-cite key="wireworld"></d-cite>, have been mathematically proven Turing-complete, underscoring their remarkable power and expressiveness. These proofs establish that despite their simple construction, such systems can perform any computation that a traditional computer can. Beyond these formal demonstrations, researchers have constructed fully functional Turing machines within these CA, albeit through arduous efforts requiring meticulous design and substantial time investment. To ease this burden, evolutionary algorithms have been employed to automate CA rule discovery <d-cite key="mitchell,sapin"></d-cite>, though these approaches still target discrete systems and specific behaviors rather than general-purpose computation.</p> <p>In recent years, the development of continuous CA has bridged the gap between discrete models and the analog characteristics of the real world. Notable examples include Lenia <d-cite key="lenia"></d-cite> and SmoothLife <d-cite key="smoothlife"></d-cite>, which extend classic CA to simulate lifelike patterns with continuous dynamics. While evolutionary search <d-cite key="reinke_intrinsically_2020,leniabreeder"></d-cite> and gradient descent <d-cite key="hamon_discovering_2024"></d-cite> have been applied to optimize continuous CA patterns, a key open question persists: are these models capable of universal computation? While the answer is likely affirmative given their expressive potential, proving this remains elusive.</p> <p>The lack of discrete states and well-defined transitions makes it harder to encode symbolic information reliably — slight perturbations can lead to significant divergence over time, undermining the stability required for computation. Moreover, continuous models often exhibit smooth, fuzzy dynamics that make it challenging to design modular components like wires, gates, or memory elements with predictable behavior. What was already a laborious task in discrete CA becomes more difficult, if not practically impossible, in the continuous domain, highlighting a fundamental challenge in building efficient analog computers.</p> <p>Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) represent a paradigm shift by replacing hand-crafted rules with neural networks trained via gradient descent <d-cite key="nca"></d-cite>. Unlike traditional CA with explicitly handcrafted rules, NCA leverage differentiable architectures where the update rule is parameterized by a neural network and optimized end-to-end. This makes it possible to <em>learn</em> complex behaviors from data, bypassing the need for manual rule design. NCAs have demonstrated success in tasks ranging from morphogenesis <d-cite key="nca"></d-cite> and classification <d-cite key="self_classifying"></d-cite> to solving reasoning challenges <d-cite key="cax"></d-cite> and growing neural networks <d-cite key="hypernca"></d-cite>. Given the Turing completeness of classical CA, NCA offer an exciting opportunity to search for computational rules through optimization, turning rule discovery into a machine learning problem. This shift is significant: the traditionally arduous task of hand-crafting rule sets that give rise to desired behaviors is now offloaded to the learning algorithm itself.</p> <p>It is important to note that the use of NCA in computational settings has precedent. Matrix copy and multiplication tasks were first implemented with NCA by Peter Whidden <d-cite key="comp_nca"></d-cite>, and our approach builds upon this foundational idea that NCA can serve as a continuous computational substrate. Very recently, researchers have demonstrated that NCA rules can be implemented using differentiable logic gates <d-cite key="difflogic_nca"></d-cite>, confirming the possibility of running self-organizing systems on standard digital hardware. Finally, in parallel to our work, a similar approach <d-cite key="engram_nca"></d-cite> was developed where cells augmented with “private memory tapes” were shown to exhibit stable, multi-task capabilities, further validating the potential of NCA as versatile computing platforms.</p> <p>Our work connects to analog computing and neuromorphic systems, which leverage biological principles like local computations <d-cite key="small_world,modular_brain,Bullmore2012TheEO"></d-cite> and co-located memory and processing to overcome the von Neumann bottleneck <d-cite key="bottlneck"></d-cite>. Neuromorphic systems implement these principles through distributed processing elements with local memory, using mixed-signal circuits that approximate neural dynamics while maintaining energy efficiency <d-cite key="neuromorphic_mead,neuromorphic_review,schuman2017surveyneuromorphiccomputingneural"></d-cite>. By exploring how systems with local interactions can implement universal computation, we aim to develop computing architectures that balance computational power with the efficiency characteristic of biological intelligence.</p> <p>In this work, we explore the potential of the Neural Cellular Automata paradigm to develop a continuous Universal Cellular Automata <d-cite key="universal_ca"></d-cite>, with the ambitious goal of inducing a universal Turing machine <d-cite key="universal_turing_machine"></d-cite> to emerge through gradient descent training. This has implications beyond academic curiosity, touching on fundamental questions about continuous dynamic systems’ computational potential and the possibility of creating universal analog computers.</p> <p>Our approach introduces: (1) a novel framework disentangling “hardware” and “state” within NCA, where CA rules serve as the physics dictating state transitions while hardware provides an immutable and heterogeneous scaffold; (2) objective functions and training setups steering NCA toward universal computation in a continuous setting; (3) experiments demonstrating the training of essential computational primitives; and (4) a demonstration of emulating a neural network directly within the CA state, solving the MNIST digit classification task. These results mark a critical first step toward sculpting continuous CA into powerful, general-purpose computational systems through gradient descent.</p> <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2> <p>We leverage the CAX <d-cite key="cax"></d-cite> library for high-performance neural cellular automata implementations and run our experiments on a single L40 GPU. Here we present a condensed overview of our approach.</p> <h3 id="general-setup">General Setup</h3> <p>Our framework demonstrates neural cellular automata’s capability to act as a general computational substrate. We introduce a novel architecture that partitions the NCA state space into two distinct components:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mutable state</strong>: The main computational workspace where inputs are transformed into outputs. This state changes through time during task execution, governed by NCA rules.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Immutable state</strong>: A specialized hardware configuration that remains fixed during any single experiment. This hardware can itself be monolithic (trained as a block, the same shape as the entire grid), modular (created from different specialized components for each task specific instance), or even generated from a graph-based hypernetwork (see Future directions). This is learned across training but fixed in any duration of a single experiment / task instance.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This separation enables a two-level optimization: at the global level, we train a general-purpose NCA rule to support diverse operations, while at the task-specific level, we optimize hardware configurations. The system adapts its dynamics using the local available hardware, similar to how different components on a motherboard enable different functions, using the same underlying physical substrate.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="background-color: white; border-radius: 8px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/unca/architecture-480.webp 480w,/assets/unca/architecture-800.webp 800w,/assets/unca/architecture-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/unca/architecture.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Schematic of our architecture, showing the distinction between mutable (computational) and immutable (hardware) states. </div> <h3 id="neural-cellular-automata">Neural Cellular Automata</h3> <p>Our NCA models solve tasks directly within their mutable state through local cell interactions, parametrized by a neural network with two key components:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Perceive Function</strong>: Gathers neighborhood information through learnable convolution filters applied to the immediate vicinity, transforming input states into a higher-dimensional perception vector.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Update Function</strong>: Utilizes the perception vector and local hardware vector to update each cell’s state. We use an attention-based update module that calculates state updates by conditioning perceived information on the local hardware.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The key innovation in our update function is an attention mechanism that allows each cell to selectively route its computation based on its local hardware. Here’s how it works:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Each cell receives a perception vector $P$ (local spatial patterns) and a hardware vector $I$ (its immutable state).</p> </li> <li> <p>The hardware vector $I$ activates different “computational modes” through an attention mechanism: $\alpha = \text{softmax}((I \cdot W_{\text{embed}}) / T)$, where $W_{\text{embed}}$ is a learned embedding matrix and $T$ is a temperature parameter controlling the sharpness of the activation.</p> </li> <li> <p>The perception vector $P$ is simultaneously processed through $N$ parallel pathways (implemented as MLPs), producing potential update vectors $V_h$ for each pathway.</p> </li> <li> <p>The final state update is computed as a weighted mixture of these pathways: $\Delta S = \sum_{h=1}^{N} \alpha_h V_h$, with the cell’s state updated residually: $S_{t+1} = S_t + \Delta S$.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This design allows the NCA to adapt its behavior dynamically based on the local hardware—cells in input regions might activate different computational pathways than those in output regions or computational zones.

However, extending this capability to continuous cellular automata presents significant challenges, primarily due to the absence of discrete states and the inherent instability of smooth, analog dynamics. In this work, we have taken pragmatic first steps toward overcoming these hurdles by leveraging NCA as a substrate for developing universal computation in a continuous domain. By employing gradient descent to train NCA rules, we have demonstrated a pathway to sculpt complex computational behaviors without the need for manual rule design, shifting the burden of discovery from human ingenuity to machine learning.</p> <p>Our results illustrate that NCA can successfully encode fundamental computational primitives, such as matrix multiplication and inversion, and even emulate a neural network capable of solving the MNIST digit classification task directly within its state. These findings suggest that NCAs can serve as a bridge between traditional computing architectures and self-organizing systems, offering a novel computational paradigm that aligns closely with analog hardware systems. This linkage is particularly promising for designing efficient computational frameworks for AI models operating under constrained resources, where energy efficiency and robustness are paramount. Rather than training entirely new rules for each task, our approach hints at the possibility of discovering optimal hardware configurations that exploit the fixed physical laws governing these substrates, enabling meaningful computations with minimal overhead.</p> <p>Looking forward, we believe this work lays the groundwork for transformative advancements in computational science. By automating the discovery of general-purpose computers within diverse physical implementations, NCA could revolutionize how we harness novel materials and systems for computation, potentially leading to ultra-efficient analog hardware systems or computational paradigms that scale linearly with resource demands. While challenges remain — such as stabilizing continuous dynamics for reliable symbolic encoding and scaling these systems to more complex tasks—the potential of NCA to unlock universal computation in continuous cellular automata opens new avenues for exploration. Ultimately, this research not only advances our understanding of computation in continuous dynamics but also paves the way for the next generation of adaptive, energy-efficient computing technologies.</p> <div class="distill-appendix"> <h3>Citation</h3> <p>For attribution in academic contexts, please cite this work as</p> <pre><code>Béna, et al., "A Path to Universal Neural Cellular Automata", Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO '25 Companion), 2025.</code></pre> <h3>BibTeX Citation</h3> <pre><code>@article{bena2025unca,
