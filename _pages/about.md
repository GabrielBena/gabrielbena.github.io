Hey ! My name is Gabriel BÃ©na, I'm a 4th year PhD Student at Imperial College London, working in the [Neural Reckoning Group](https://neural-reckoning.org/) under the supervision of Dan Goodman. I am also a part-time neuromorphic researcher at [SpiNNcloud Systems](https://spinncloud.com/). My interest are broad but have lately aligned with the field of neuromorphic engineering. I study the structure-function relationship in neural-networks, understanding how structural modularity relates to functional specialization and compositional knowledge abilities, especially in ressource-constrained architectures. I've also studied Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), especially the topic of multimodal integration, and I am currently an active developer of the [SNN software stack for SpiNNaker2](https://gitlab.com/spinnaker2/py-spinnaker2). Finally, I am fascinated by self-organising systems and have recently been trying to understand how continuous neural cellular automata can be harnessed as a [universal computational medium](https://gabrielbena.github.io/blog/2025/bena2025unca/).
